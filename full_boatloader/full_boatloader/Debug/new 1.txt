PROPOSED TO : VALEO - EGYPT


Problem Statement:
CURRENT vehicles contain hundreds or thousands of ECUS SO IF THERE IS UPDATE , BUG OR
new feature , we want to add ,this will cost high value and specific devices ,if the new update
flash in maintenance center , so we to method to flash new update wireless

===============================
WHY FOTA?

Many embedded systems are bulid in places that are difficult or for 
a human to work with (especially in IOT APPS and vehicles).
 
This apps always need update to fix bugs so we found that FOTA is the best and
cheapest solution.


==============================

Project Objective:

This project aims to design FOTA system to
update the flash memory with as little memory as possible
And secure data

============================================
Hardware Requirements:

--STM32 ( FOR MASTER AND TARGETS)

--WIFI MODULE

-- SOME SENSORS TO BULID ECUS OF TARGETS (ULTRASONIC , BUZZER , SERVO MOTOR ,...)


Software Requirements:
--cloud server to upload hex file
--GUI to choose target and hex file before upload
--Bootloader / Boot Manager to update flash in runtime


===========================================================================

State Diagram:

put picture here:_____________________________________


===============================================
Technical Approach:

3 main stages:

-user choose new hex file will be uploaded to Cloud Server and determind the target
then compare old hex file with new hex file to select which pages will update

-MASTER ECU will access Cloud Server every specific time , and find if there is 
new update , then determind target and download new update and save it in 
specific space in memory

-NEW UPDATE will send to target and Bootloader part in ECU will deal with data and
backup previous flash to avoid any error or problem in update
